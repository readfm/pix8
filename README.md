## About
Package can be openned in three different environments
chrome extension - go to chrome://extensions/ , mark "Developer mode" , click 'Load unpacked' and link this folder
electron app - just open electron/pix8.exe and you will see it running in your task bar
web app - click on run.cmd and open it in browser http://m/word


## Install
Before installing make sure you have, electron, git, https://datproject.org and https://nodejs.org/en/ installed.
To be able to edit visual data https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html is recomended
Once you got git cloned, open that folder and run npm installer to get all the rest dependencies

    git clone https://github.com/readfm/pix8.git # or your own fork on Github
    cd pix8
    npm install
    
once its done, etract ffmpeg bin folder and make sure you link ffmpeg bin's correctly in config.yaml file
    
## System structure
It's recomended to keep required folders along with pix8. But all defaults can be changed in config.yaml
By default configuration data will be taken from config.yaml file and can be extended by ../config.yaml (if the one was created)

## Data model
System is using jQuery like way of interacting with source, within new Link(url) can be passed path of supported data format
For now we are using DAT to manage data, later it can be extended by IPFS and NDN 

## Configuration
Right now we dont have setup environment to do installation and configuration steps within simple UI,
but if you preffer edit yourself, open config.yaml

    port: 80 #default port to access WEB version
    storage:
      home: 'C:\8\me'           # public location of where to store your personal data
      private: 'C:\8\private'   # folder with an imformation that cant be shared with anybody
      items: 'C:\8\items'       # where we store initial DAT elements
      dats: 'C:\8\dats'         # default spot where to store external dat packages
      wiki: 'C:\8\wiki'         # refactored wiki html pages
      youtubes: 'C:\8\youtubes' # downloaded youtube videos, before it gets converted
    ggif_app: 'C:\8\ggif'       # leave empty if you dont need https://github.com/readfm/ggif

    ffmpeg: '../bin/ffmpeg.exe'     #path of video codecs
    ffprobe: '../bin/ffprobe.exe'   # from https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html

next edit C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts with admin permissions and add
    127.0.0.1	  pix8.lh preload.lh 8 m m8

## System Requirements
pi8 can run on most Linux, macOS, and Windows systems. We recommend running it on a machine with at least 2 GB of RAM .
